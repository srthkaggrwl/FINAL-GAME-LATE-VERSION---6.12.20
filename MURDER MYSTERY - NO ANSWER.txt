MR.HENRY CROWE
A man in his mid 40s, pharmacist, he was wearing a long sleeve jacket with
legs crossed.
''I have known Basil ever since he moved into our building.
 He has been a close friend and the moment I heard what happened and 
 I was terrified. He never deserved this, he was a great artist and 
 great man. Last time I saw him was yesterday evening in the park 
 when we both went for walks. If I knew anything more than that
 I would have surely helped you Officer''



#REPORT 3 ( APPEND 2 )

MRS. CROWE
A woman in her late 30s, housewife, she was wearing a red dress with a handkerchief
in her hand, mourning the loss.
'' This is horrible. Basil was really a good man and only a really wicked man
   could do something like this to a generous man like him. When Henry wasn't home
   for a few weeks, Basil always helped me with getting groceries and whenever I
   needed his help. The last time I saw him was when he left with my husband to
   go the pub to have a few drinks since they had to celebrate Basil's 50th
   painting, the subject being Henry himself. He was a great artist and 
   drew things which brought out the subject in a very raw form , in a way 
   only a true artist could.''



#REPORT 4 ( APPEND 3)

MR.DORIAN WILDE
A man in his late 20s, an amatuer painter. He was wearing a waist coat with a gray hat.
'' Mr.Basil has always been my mentor and he had taught me a lot about the art form. Its
   just sad to hear that such a great man was murdered in his own house, in his art studio
   a place which he loved and stayed all day to do his work. The last time I saw him was 
   in the pub with Mr. Henry. I didn't approach him because they seemed to have a very
   friendly conversation which i didn't wanna ruin with my unnecessary questions about art.''
