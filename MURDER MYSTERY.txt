------ 

MR.HENRY CROWE
A man in his mid 40s, pharmacist, he was wearing a long sleeve jacket with
legs crossed.
''I have known Basil ever since he moved into our building.
 He has been a close friend and the moment I heard what happened and 
 I was terrified. He never deserved this, he was a great artist and 
 great man. Last time I saw him was yesterday evening in the park 
 when we both went for walks. If I knew anything more than that
 I would have surely helped you Officer''

The CCTV Cameras were switched off at night. The only CCTV camera footage
was of the enterance to the building but no one in a waist coat and grey hat
entered or left the building. The police also found traces of tranquilizer in the
victim's blood.

#REPORT 3 ( APPEND 2 )

MRS. CROWE
A woman in her late 30s, housewife, she was wearing a red dress with a handkerchief
in her hand, mourning the loss.
'' This is horrible. Basil was really a good man and only a really wicked man
   could do something like this to a generous man like him. When Henry wasn't home
   for a few weeks, Basil always helped me with getting groceries and whenever I
   needed his help. The last time I saw him was when he left with my husband to
   go the pub to have a few drinks since they had to celebrate Basil's 50th
   painting, the subject being Henry himself. He was a great artist and 
   drew things which brought out the subject in a very raw form , in a way 
   only a true artist could.''

EVEDINCE 2:
There were fingerprints found in the appartment which belonged to Mr.Dorian Wilde,
Mr. Basil's close associate. 

#REPORT 4 ( APPEND 3)

MR.DORIAN WILDE
A man in his late 20s, an amatuer painter. He was wearing a waist coat with a gray hat.
'' Mr.Basil has always been my mentor and he had taught me a lot about the art form. Its
   just sad to hear that such a great man was murdered in his own house, in his art studio
   a place which he loved and stayed all day to do his work. The last time I saw him was 
   in the pub with Mr. Henry. I didn't approach him because they seemed to have a very
   friendly conversation which i didn't wanna ruin with my unnecessary questions about art.''

EVIDENCE 3:
One of the neighbours saw Mrs.Crowe visit Mr.Basil at his house whenever Mr.Henry was out of 
the city for work.

in the painting have their belongings on the table next to the subject. You take another look
at the unfinished painting on the canvas. You have your facts ready. Its time to arrest the
murderer. 

#REPORT 6 ( APPEND 5)



# SCORE CALCULATE

# RESULT


REAL ANSWER:
Mr. Henry is the real murderer although he did a great job at hiding it. He never had to exit  
the building and after slicing Mr.Basil's throat with a surgical knife which he got from his 
own store very easily. The painting was the biggest clue, the gold watch that belonged to the 
subject was worn by Mr.Henry during his interview and he was wearing a long sleeve jacket
in summer which obviously meant that he tried to hide the gold watch. The grey hat and the 
waist coat which Mr. Dorian always wore was worn by you to point the murder towards him. The
motive of the murder was as simple as it could be. Mrs.Crowe was having an affair with Mr.Basil,
the painting and the way she talked about him gave it away. The day Henry found out about it, 
he took him to a pub and drugged him. He went to his appartment for finishing his last painting,
slashed his throat and took an innocent man's life as revenge.
