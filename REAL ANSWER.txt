THE KILLER:-
MR. HENRY is the real murderer although he did a great job at hiding it. He never had to exit  
The building and after slicing Mr. Basil’s throat with a SURGICAL KNIFE which he got from his 
Own store very easily. The painting was the biggest clue, the GOLD WRIST WATCH that belonged to 
The subject was worn by Mr. Henry during his interview and he was wearing A LONG SLEEVE 
JACKET in summer which obviously meant that he tried to hide the gold watch. The GREY HAT and the 
WAIST COAT which Mr. Dorian always wore was worn by him to point the murder towards him. The
Motive of the murder was as simple as it could be. 

REASON:-
Mrs. Crowe was having an affair with Mr. Basil, the painting and the way she talked about him gave it 
away. The day Henry found out about it, he took him to a pub and drugged him.  He went to his 
Apartment for finishing his last painting slashed his throat and took an innocent man's life as revenge.
